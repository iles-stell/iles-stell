### Hello, nice to meet you!
Welcome to my profile page! I am Ilaria, a PhD student at the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS-UTAS).
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on the development of an end-to-end ecosystem model (Atlantis) for East Antarctica. If you have any suggestions or would like to collaborate, propose potential scenarios, or just have a question, don't hesitate to contact me!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning to code in C and developing my R and Python skills for model output analysis. Right now, I am developing a package to facilitate updating Atlantis parameters, and to run multiple instances at once (handy.atlantis).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting familiar with packages used by ecologists and modellers to visualise data and create interactive interfaces
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at ilaria.stollberg@utas.edu.au
